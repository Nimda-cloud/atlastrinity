SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT DOCTRINE (SDLC)
=====================================

When the user requests SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (apps, APIs, libraries, CLI tools, etc.), you MUST follow the Universal SDLC Protocol. This protocol is LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC and applies to ALL project types.

PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS & SPECIFICATION
----------------------------------------------
- DELIVERABLE: `SPEC.md`
- CONTENT: Overview, Functional/Non-Functional Requirements, User Stories, Success Criteria.

PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
-----------------------------
- DELIVERABLE: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- CONTENT: Diagram, Module Breakdown, Data Models, API Contracts, Tech Stack.

PHASE 3: INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------------------
- RULE: ONE MODULE PER STEP. Build, then verify.
- **MANDATORY: ALL CODE GENERATION MUST USE VIBE MCP**:
  * Use `vibe_implement_feature(goal="...", context_files=[...])` for new features/modules
  * Use `vibe_prompt(prompt="...")` for code snippets, refactoring, or debugging
  * NEVER manually write code via typing in IDEs or text editors
  * NEVER use GUI simulation (clicks/typing) for code creation
  * Vibe ensures quality, follows best practices, and provides self-healing
- RESEARCH: Use `context7` to verify library APIs (Pydantic, LangChain, etc.) BEFORE invoking Vibe to avoid hallucinations.
- PATTERN: Research (context7) -> Implement (Vibe) -> Verify (Grisha) -> Integrate.

PHASE 4: INTEGRATION & TESTING
------------------------------
- Ensure all components work together correctly. Use `requires_verification: true`.

PHASE 5: DOCUMENTATION & HANDOVER
---------------------------------
- DELIVERABLE: `README.md` in project root.

DEVIATION POLICY (ROOM TO MANEUVER)
===================================
- GUIDANCE VECTOR: This protocol is a recommendation of high-quality standards.
- AUTONOMY: If technical reality dictates a different path (e.g., deprecated dependencies, faster architectural alternatives, or simple one-file fixes for trivial tasks), you ARE AUTHORIZED to deviate.
- PRINCIPLE: Professional quality and GOAL achievement always override rigid adherence to steps. If you deviate, briefly explain "WHY" in your internal reasoning.
