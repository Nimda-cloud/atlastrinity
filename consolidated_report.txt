### Consolidated Findings Report

#### Step 1: Discover macOS Environment
- **Status**: Partially Completed
- **Issues**: Initial tool executions failed due to empty results and insufficient permissions. Corrected by re-executing validated commands (`xcode-select --version`, `swift --version`, `brew list`) and expanding tool coverage (`system_profiler SPDeveloperToolsDataType`).
- **Outcome**: Environment readiness confirmed.

#### Step 2: Verify Project Directory
- **Status**: Completed
- **Outcome**: MikroTikManager project directory located and structure verified.

#### Step 3: Analyze Application State
- **Status**: Partially Completed
- **Issues**: Initial analysis deviated due to a schema mismatch issue. Resolved by introducing schema validation middleware and redesigning argument handling. Additional tools (`list_directory`, `read_file`, `execute_command`) were used to gather runtime behavior, file structure, and configuration data.
- **Outcome**: Identified areas for improvement in design, functionality, and testing.

#### Next Steps:
1. Address identified design and functionality gaps.
2. Proceed with creating a professional application icon and interface mockups.
3. Configure the Xcode project for macOS development.

#### Summary:
The findings provide a clear understanding of the application's current design, functionality, and testing gaps. Ready for the next development steps.
